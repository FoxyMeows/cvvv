        <p>I am currently a student studying web developement. Previously, I was working toward a
          degree in nursing. However, I decided to change directions in my career after taking into
          account the many pros and cons of both career paths. I also have two children, both boys, aged 10 months and 9 years.
          They bring me great joy and challenge to my daily life! </p>
